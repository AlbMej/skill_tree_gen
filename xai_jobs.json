By accelerating iteration cycles through smart experimentation, you&#39;ll empower our teams to make data-informed decisions that keep our AI at the cutting edge of user delight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Insight Extraction&lt;/strong&gt;: Dive into production logs and behavioral data to identify patterns of dissatisfaction, using mathematical and statistical tools to distill why users may not engage with or appreciate aspects of our AI models.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimentation Design&lt;/strong&gt;: Craft and execute fast-paced experiments, such as A/B tests or multivariate trials, to validate hypotheses on product features and measure their impact on user experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noisy Signal Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply advanced stats and creative analytical techniques to interpret ambiguous data streams, uncovering hidden correlations and causal factors that inform product improvements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;: Synthesize findings into clear, evidence-based strategies for product decisions, prioritizing quick wins and long-term enhancements to boost model usability and appeal.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Iteration&lt;/strong&gt;: Optimize experimentation pipelines for speed, enabling frequent testing and refinement cycles that allow the team to pivot based on real-time user signals and evolving needs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideal Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical and Statistical Mastery&lt;/strong&gt;: Profound skills in math, probability, statistics, and inference, with a proven ability to apply them creatively to real-world problems in dynamic tech environments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimentation Expertise&lt;/strong&gt;: Hands-on experience designing and analyzing product experiments (e.g., A/B testing, causal inference), with a track record of accelerating iteration in AI or software products.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytical Creativity&lt;/strong&gt;: Demonstrated talent for teasing insights from noisy, high-volume data sources like logs and metrics, leading to innovative solutions that address user pain points without model training.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Decision Support&lt;/strong&gt;: Background in using data-driven methods to guide strategic choices, such as identifying suboptimal features and proposing fixes in fast-paced settings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative Agility&lt;/strong&gt;: 3+ years in engineering roles at innovative companies, where you&#39;ve balanced technical rigor with creative thinking to deliver quick, impactful iterations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We hire engineers in Palo Alto.
